# Description

## Story

The procession of the Numbian Princess travels across the desert to forge an alliance. 
Hidden among the convoy are representatives of the Nomads, who seek to protect their oases from being taken over after the alliance is formed. 
For this reason, they aim to prevent the journey across the desert by restricting access to water.
During each stop, the convoy sends emissaries to gather water, but at the wells they encounter Nomad representatives who impose a toll on their use. 
The emissaries must negotiate access to the water.
If the Nomads succeed in depleting the convoy’s water supplies, the convoy perishes in the desert, and the Nomads retreat to their allied strongholds.

## Genre & Theme

**Genre**: Social Deduction / Hidden Identity

**Theme**: The game is set in a mythical late-Antiquity era, drawing inspiration from a blend of Ancient Egyptian mysticism and nomadic Saharan cultures.

**Art Style**: Stylized realism with high-contrast lighting—utilizing deep shadows (for mystery) and golden, sun-bleached hues (for the desert heat).

# Game mechanics

## Overview

The designed game is based on hidden identity mechanics, where players are divided into secret factions and assigned specific roles with associated privileged information. 
The core game loop follows a turn-based structure, where each turn consists of selecting a subset of players that satisfies the specific mission requirements for that round. 
Once the selection is approved, the chosen team represents the collective during the task execution, the outcome of which directly progresses the game toward the ultimate victory conditions.

## Available Roles

The roles available in the game are divided into two main fractions: 
1. The Royal Convoy: Their goal is to secure enough water to reach the alliance meeting. They must identify the infiltrators before the supplies run dry.
2. The Desert Nomads: If the convoy runs out of water or the Priestess die, the Nomads win and retreat to their desert strongholds.
