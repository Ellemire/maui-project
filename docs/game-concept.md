# Introduction

This document outlines the core concept of the game, including its genre, description, core loop, and target platforms.

# Description

The designed game is based on hidden identity mechanics, where players are divided into secret factions and assigned specific roles with associated privileged information. 
The core game loop follows a turn-based structure, where each turn consists of selecting a subset of players that satisfies the specific mission requirements for that round. 
Once the selection is approved, the chosen team represents the collective during the task execution, the outcome of which directly progresses the game toward the ultimate victory conditions.

The narrative follows the Convoy of the Numbian Princess as it treks across a treacherous desert to forge a vital political alliance.
However, the convoy is infiltrated by Desert Nomads — saboteurs who seek to protect their oases from foreign control by depleting the convoy’s water supplies.

Each round centers on the survival of the convoy as it moves from one desert well to the next, requiring careful selection of "Emissaries" to manage negotiations with the locals.

## Genre & Theme

**Genre**: Social Deduction / Hidden Identity

**Theme**: The game is set in a mythical late-Antiquity era, drawing inspiration from a blend of Ancient Egyptian mysticism and nomadic Saharan cultures.
While the Princess seeks to unite two nations through a political marriage, the Nomads view this alliance as a death sentence for their ancestral lands.

**Art Style**: Stylized realism with high-contrast lighting—utilizing deep shadows (for mystery) and golden, sun-bleached hues (for the desert heat).

## Available Roles

The roles available in the game are divided into two main factions: 
1. The Royal Convoy: Their goal is to secure enough water to reach the alliance meeting. They must identify the infiltrators before the supplies run dry.
2. The Desert Nomads: If the convoy runs out of water or the Priestess die, the Nomads win and retreat to their desert strongholds.
