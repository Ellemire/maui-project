# maui-project
A non-profit fun-made project focused on developing a cross-platform card game using .NET MAUI. We want to navigate the full lifecycle of product development: from initial requirements and UI/UX design to final implementation. Our goal is to challange and improve our project management, team cooperation and software engineering skills.
